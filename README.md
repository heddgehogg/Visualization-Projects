# Data Visualization Project

Welcome to my creative data storytelling project, where I explore **consumer behavior**, **global trends**, **and death statistics** â€” all visualized through maps, word clouds, and charts. This project combines real-world data with a focus on sustainability, fashion, and social patterns.

## Project Structure ##

| File/Folder                           | Description                                                                    |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| data/                                 | Contains cleaned and raw datasets used across notebooks.                       |
| images/                               | Stores generated visualizations (word clouds, useful images etc.).             |
| visualization_clothes_habits.ipynb    | Analyzes consumer habits in sustainable fashion and second-hand clothing.      |
| visualization_maps.ipynb              | Displays map-based insights (e.g., fashion trends by country).                 |
| visualization_of_mortality.ipynb      | Visual storytelling on causes of death globally.                               |
| visualization_wordClouds.ipynb        | Creates engaging word clouds based on text data (e.g., reasons for purchases). |

## Project Goals ##
- Segment and analyze consumers based on their sustainable fashion choices.
- Visualize global death causes for awareness and education.
- Map country-level trends to understand geographic differences in behavior.
- Present data in a fun, interactive, and clear way using Python.

## Key Highlights ##
- Mapping sustainable behavior: Who shops sustainably and where?
- Insightful clustering: Grouping users by purchase reasons, values, and behavior.
- Social awareness: Visual analysis of how people die globally (based on data).
- Fashion with a conscience: Understand the rise of second-hand fashion.
